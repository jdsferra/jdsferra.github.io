The app is hosted [here](https://jdsferra.shinyapps.io/Magnificent7/), the code is [here](https://github.com/jdsferra/MAGNIFICENT7), and a blog post discussing the project in further detail is [here](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/understanding-the-magnificent-seven-stocks/).

Interactive dashboard in R/Shiny examining the "Magnificent Seven" stocks while comparing their performance to the S&P 500. While avoiding giving investing advice, I illustrate the Seven's outsize share of the S&P's total market cap, suggesting that these companies' performances (boosted by Covid-19 and the craze for AI) are inflating the S&P's overall performance.

In the app, you can customize several visualizations of the Mag7 stocks and their performance compared to the S&P.
