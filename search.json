    "text": "Data professional finishing my fellowship at NYC Data Science Academy. I am working on a capstone project to provide a report card on the health of a business via documenting executive turnover. Experienced in SQL, Python, and R.\nI recently completed an internship at Articulate.AI that involved collaborating on the redesign of a no-code chatbot interface and produced a series of demo videos. I analyzed chatbot logs to suggest revisions to clients’ bots and assisted in the onboarding process. I am now on a contract there as a Pre-Sales Data Scientist.\nI grew up in Ohio and earned a PhD in music composition at SUNY-Stony Brook. Over eight years, I taught music theory and composition at Stony Brook, Earlham, Vassar, SUNY-Potsdam, and the Cleveland Institute of Music. I presented at six academic conferences, published three peer-reviewed works, and was featured as a clarinetist on two professional albums. I now live in the New York metropolitan area and am looking for full-time data analyst/scientist roles and roles in implementation, onboarding, and customer success.\nMy background as a musician and teacher means that I have a unique approach to problem-solving that combines creativity and analytical skills. I have a proven record of translating complex ideas into concrete solutions for diverse audiences. Brainstorming and collaborating are some of my favorite things to do.\nCheck out the portfolio tab, which includes my data analytics and data science projects with links to code, deeper blog posts about the projects, and videos discussing my approach. I’m looking forward to populating my personal blog here with more thoughts about data, education, creative problem solving, statistics, coding, music, and more!"

    "text": "Taylor Ackley, a professor of music at Brandeis University, and I wrote a book chapter about our experience founding an American Roots music ensemble while we were grad students at Stony Brook University. We featured instruments from classical traditions and performers from jazz and chamber music backgrounds all playing folk music by ear. Check out one of our albums!\nWhile we were successful as a performing group on Long Island, our approach sometimes conflicted with typical instruction musicians receive in higher ed in America. Taylor and I told the stories of these conflicts through Taylor’s experience as a way of encouraging students to give this approach a try, and encouraging educators to challenge their own expectations about what makes a successful graduate-level ensemble. We got to write about a lot of things that are important to us, including the complicated history of American popular music, race, and class in the 20th century. I loved getting to write about my experience playing clarinet in church as a boy, and I love Taylor’s first line of the conclusion that reads:\n\n“This chapter has purposefully presented big questions without offering any real answers.” (!!!)\n\nCheck out the book here.\nI have to admit, it is a little bittersweet to be reading our chapter now since I decided to leave academia a little more than a year ago. Taylor and I drafted the proposal for this chapter in the summer of 2020, when many things about our lives weren’t certain. Publication can be a pivotal step in gaining seniority and better job placement as a college professor, so there is a kind of dull pain that runs alongside my sense of pride and accomplishment holding the book in my hands. Brainstorming about creative projects and collaborating on them are still some of my favorite things to do, and this last year has involved stretching these skills in new and unpredictable ways for me. But I will always be proud of Taylor and myself for our enduring friendship, the writing we’ve done together, and most importantly, the music."

    "text": "During my career as a music theory professor, I saw the same freshmen in my classroom five days a week. Our classroom, inevitably, became the site not just of learning a difficult subject at a fast pace, but also of discussions about what strategies could help you do that. As a Data Science Fellow at NYCDSA, I’ve continued to rely on these strategies and wanted to share some of them with you as you a coding bootcamp. Writing these thoughts out, I found all of them revolving around two major ideas: 1. You’re not behind. 2. You’re not alone."

    "text": "You’re Not Behind\nWhen you first see the extent of a bootcamp curriculum, you may feel overwhelmed. It has to be that wide to address all the foundational knowledge for today’s tech stacks and job market. With so much to learn, it’s easy to feel like you are always behind.\nI’ve discovered in my chats with former and current boot campers that everyone feels behind at some point. The truth is that while everyone in a cohort sometimes feels behind, they are also ahead of and alongside each other in various ways. These differences come from our diverse backgrounds, bringing prior strengths and skills that contribute to our understanding of data science differently. Virtual cohorts allows a great diversity of backgrounds in your community, and we can all learn from each other.\nAfter you start, you’ll find that your background will help you grasp some of the lessons relatively easily. Whether it’s the stats, the coding, domain knowledge, or communication skills, your experiences will help you pick up on certain parts of the curriculum more quickly than others. The others in your cohort will feel themselves as behind you at some point in the program, just like when you feel behind them. That we don’t have the same talents doesn’t mean the ones we have are any less valuable. As a musician, I always felt like I couldn’t play as fast and as high on my clarinet as my peers, but I could learn songs by ear and improvise better than a lot of them. In the same way, you’ll find aspects of the curriculum where you shine as long as you keep at it!\nMake the most of the experience and strike the right balance between feeling behind and feeling like you already know the material. When a session feels too advanced, think of it as a sort of heads-up about vocabulary and concepts that will come up in your career. When more basic classes feel too easy, think of it as a chance to solidify what you’ve been learning.\nI confided in NYCDSA’s director that I felt worried about falling behind in the program, and she comforted me by encouraging me to reframe my “timeline” from the weeks of the bootcamp to time I needed for “learning data science well and using it in my new career”. On that path, none of us are behind."

    "text": "You’re Not Alone\nOnline instruction formats allow incredible flexibility and global collaboration. It’s easy to feel isolated, though, and that feeling can depress you and slow your learning. That’s why I urge you to capitalize on the synchronous portions of your program like the office hours and meetings with mentors. Be proactive about coming to live sessions. Turn your camera on, say “Hi”, ask questions, and message people who attended. Reaching out helps you feel connected and human as you learn, and the people at these sessions may become collaborators, coworkers, or friends in the coming years. Nearly everyone I’ve reached out to for advice on domain knowledge or help with a project has been willing to meet and chat.\nHelping out doesn’t necessarily mean teaching: it can just mean lending support. For example, I joined a study group that doesn’t even talk about the material; we just come together virtually on Zoom with our cameras on to keep us motivated and focused. You’re less likely to allow yourself to procrastinate if you’ll get caught! Even in a group like that, I know that I’m not alone and that I have people I can root for as they cheer me on, too.\nIf you keep at the front of your mind that you’re neither behind nor alone, you’ll be set up for staying on track. These are long-term goals, so think about where you want to end up and stick with it. Happy studying!"

    "text": "It was surreal to get to present alongside Vivian Zhang as part of the ACCET Faculty Professional Development Day last week. ACCET is an accrediting body focusing on continuing education and accredits NYC Data Science Academy. As somebody who has spent a great deal of time in the classroom and on Zoom presentations like this, it was fun to get back into my element and present!\nVivian’s introduction to AI was superb, but what I found most impressive about her presentation was her ability to respond extemporaneously to questions from the Zoom chat. The chat had about 125 participants, and a lot of them had questions they wanted answered! The chat was full of educators, so lots of questions centered around plagiarism and how to hold students to a meaningful standard despite the power of generative AI. There were questions about Tesla, housekeeping robots, what work AI should be doing, and many more.\nIn my portion of the presentation, I spoke about a use case for AI in an educational setting, namely Articulate.AI where I interned this summer, and am now on a contract as a Pre-Sales Data Scientist. After the flurry of questions about all of AI’s capabilities, I honed in on a specific use case of AI as a way of streamlining the work of an admissions or enrollment office. As an educator, I found myself sending lots of emails to students with the same exact information over and over. This bot could automate a lot of that work, but more importantly, tailor its approach to students by asking them questions and even giving them recommendations. It was very cool to show off some of what makes the bot work to a big group of educators, and I had a great time.\n\n\n\nJust a little snippet of what I showed. Click Articulate’s link to see more!\n\n\nThank you to Vivian for this opportunity! Her mentorship has been incredible and I am very grateful :)."

    "text": "Predicting Real Estate Prices Using Machine Learning\nImplemented multiple machine learning models in Python and Scikit-learn to predict house prices using the Ames dataset from Kaggle. The process involved data cleaning and preparation, feature engineering, preprocessing, and modeling. Models included Linear Regression, Penalized Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.\nMy approach highlighted the trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability in ML models. Multiple Linear Regression was my endpoint of interpretability over accuracy, while Gradient Boosting was my endpoint of accuracy over interpretability. By doing a deep dive on these two models, I illustrate the endpoints of accessibility and accuracy in order to inform realtors and home buyers and sellers about the best ways to approach the real estate market. My analysis suggests that big factors like square footage and number of bedrooms and bathrooms factors into home prices, but preparing the data with subtler interactions like “rooms multiplied by bedrooms” can help ML models discover deeper differences between similar homes and yield more accurate sale price predictions.\n\n\n\nAs ML models increase in accuracy, they decrease in interpretability, and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression: Highly Interpretable, but less accurate than other models.\n\n\n\n\n\nGradient Boosting: Highly Accurate, but less interpretable than other models.\n\n\nMy code can be found here and a blog post discussing the project in further detail is here.\nMy talk begins at 0:35."

    "text": "Words to Learn to Solve the New York Times Crossword Puzzle\nThis analysis is targeted towards people who have done some crossword puzzles but want to take their efforts more seriously and improve their game. While simply practicing doing crossword puzzles consistently is obviously a great way to improve, analysis on a dataset containing all the clues and answers from NYT puzzles between 1993-2021 reveals some trends about the words that commonly feature so that players can study them away from the puzzles and speed up their improvement.\nAfter some descriptive analysis of the dataset using Python, including examining missing values and some feature engineering involving word length, days of the week, and vowel ratios of the words. After briefly analyzing the most-common clues, I make a list of the most commonly-featured words in these puzzles. This list isn’t a great study tool, though, because a lot of these words are already known to the average English-language speaker.\nSo, I cross-reference this list with a second list, 5,050 of the most common and currently-used words in the English language. By eliminating these words from the puzzle list, I create a valuable study guide: a list of words that are both common in the NYT Crossword puzzle, but are perhaps not known to the average person starting out.   My code can be found here and a blog post discussing the project in further detail is here.\nThanks for taking a look!"
