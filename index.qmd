Data professional finishing my fellowship at [NYC Data Science Academy](http://www.nycdatascience.com). I am working on a capstone project to provide a report card on the health of a business via documenting executive turnover. Experienced in SQL, Python, and R.

I grew up in Ohio and earned a PhD in music composition at SUNY-Stony Brook. Over eight years, I taught music theory and composition at Stony Brook, Earlham, Vassar, SUNY-Potsdam, and the Cleveland Institute of Music. I presented at six academic conferences, published three peer-reviewed works, and was featured as a clarinetist on two professional albums. I now live in the New York metropolitan area.  

My background as a musician and teacher means that I have a unique approach to problem-solving that combines creativity and analytical skills. I have a proven record of translating complex ideas into concrete solutions for diverse audiences. Brainstorming and collaborating are some of my favorite things to do.  

You can view my coding projects on [Github](http://www.github.com/jdsferra) and blog posts about these projects [here](http://www.nycdatascience.com/blog/author/jdsferra).
