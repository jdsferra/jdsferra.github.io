For a lot of them, it becomes the bane of their existence, as it relies on an understanding of math that they haven't used much. To add insult to injury, matrices are used for atonal music, the kind of music that isn't always pleasant to listen to! I thought that by coding a matrix generator out in Python, I could atone for subjecting so many of my students to this technique and learn a little something myself.\n\nTo understand the matrix, we have to understand a little bit about music in the early twentieth century. At that time, musicians were reaching out to find new musical techniques to express themselves and their feelings about the world around them. Many felt adrift in the wake of conflicts like World War I, and to mirror that \"adrift-ness\" in their music, they abandoned the idea of tonality, or a central pitch that feels like \"home\" or the point of arrival in a piece of music. One technique they used to replace tonality was to use a \"tone row\", a sequence of all 12 pitches in the chromatic scale, as their new \"home\". The tone row gave them the opportunity to make music with wild new sounds and harmonies, but also some kind of \"home\" (even if it's a whole lot harder to hear!). \n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvbuUzDRVes>}}\n\n::: {#35e9f566 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef modconvert(num):\n  if num >= 0 and num < 12:\n    return num\n  else:\n    return num % 12\n\nfor num in range(-6, 0):\n  print(f\"{num} modconverts to {modconvert(num)}\")\nfor num in range(12, 19):\n  print(f\"{num} modconverts to {modconvert(num)}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n-6 modconverts to 6\n-5 modconverts to 7\n-4 modconverts to 8\n-3 modconverts to 9\n-2 modconverts to 10\n-1 modconverts to 11\n12 modconverts to 0\n13 modconverts to 1\n14 modconverts to 2\n15 modconverts to 3\n16 modconverts to 4\n17 modconverts to 5\n18 modconverts to 6\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTaylor Ackley, a professor of music at Brandeis University, and I wrote a book chapter about our experience founding an American Roots music ensemble while we were grad students at Stony Brook University. We featured instruments from classical traditions and performers from jazz and chamber music backgrounds all playing folk music by ear. Check out one of our [albums!](https://taylorackley.bandcamp.com/)   \n\nWhile we were successful as a performing group on Long Island, our approach sometimes conflicted with typical instruction musicians receive in higher ed in America. Taylr and I told the stories of these conflicts through Taylor's experience as a way of encouraging students to give this approach a try, and encouraging educators to challenge their own expectations about what makes a successful graduate-level ensemble. We got to write about a lot of things that are important to us, including the complicated history of American popular music, race, and class in the 20th century. I loved getting to write about my experience playing clarinet in church as a boy, and I love Taylor's first line of the conclusion that reads:\n\n> ***\"This chapter has purposefully presented big questions without offering any real answers.\" (!!!)***\n\nCheck out the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Business-Creative-Industries-Education/dp/1800505221/).  \n\nI have to admit, it is a little bittersweet to be reading our chapter now since I decided to leave academia a little more than a year ago. Taylor and I drafted the proposal for this chapter in the summer of 2020, when many things about our lives weren't certain. Publication can be a pivotal step in gaining seniority and better job placement as a college professor, so there is a kind of dull pain that runs alongside my sense of pride and accomplishment holding the book in my hands. Brainstorming about creative projects and collaborating on them are still some of my favorite things to do, and this last year has involved stretching these skills in new and unpredictable ways for me. But I will always be proud of Taylor and myself for our enduring friendship, the writing we've done together, and most importantly, the music.\n\n",
